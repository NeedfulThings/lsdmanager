*News*

13 Sep 2013: v1.0

  * A number of improvements done by Craphazzard:
    * remember directories from last run
    * import + export multiple songs in one go
    * native look & feel
  * Tidy up song list

9 Jan 2012: v0.9. Bugfix: Added check that a song is selected when clicking "export .lsdsng" or "clear slot" buttons. (Before fix, LSD-Manager would just export random junk.) Thanks to Curtis Ware!

3 Apr 2011: v0.8. LSD-Manager will now try to open v3 .sav files even if they are smaller than 128kB. This may be necessary since some emulators/backup devices seem to truncate the .sav files if there is unused space at the end...

3 Feb 2007: v0.7. Fix for Japanese white Nintendo Power cartridges. Thanx Xinon!

1 Feb 2007: v0.6. Another bugfix for .lsdsng add. Thanx Rabato!

20 Dec 2006: v0.5. Bugfixed .lsdsng add.
